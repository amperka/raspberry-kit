# OOPS.. You've got yourself a better Raspberry Pi! It's B+!

It happens to be, that fellows from Raspberry managed to update their Raspberry Pi 3B controller up to Model B+ and we somehow missed it. It means that our book — the one you've found in the box, is somewhat obsolete.

Sorry for that.   
:flushed:

But it's no big deal!    
This patch is made precisely to fix this.   
Here you can find up to date instructions to all chapters which have to be modified.

Check up the list of the pages where the difference between models 3B and 3B+ appears.   
When you get to the listed page in the book, just look up this instruction to fix your code.

Let's get to it.

## Page 4. RASPBERRY PI
Obviuosly, Raspberry Pi 3B+ looks different:

## Page 7.
Shift+alt no longer swithes the language. Pity.

## Page 8. WI-FI
Nothing wrong with this one.    
Just it says that it is possible to set up Wi-Fi via SSH and doesn't say how.   
Actually SSH instruction is there, in the book on page 56. Just FYI.

## Page 13. CONSOLE
Console — The good oldfashioned hackerman stuff.   
The console screenshot is different with new Raspberry:
